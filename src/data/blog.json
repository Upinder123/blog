            "blogText": "ES lint is a tool  which helps in statically analyzing your code to quickly find problems. ESLint is built into most text editors and you can run ESLint as part of your continuous integration pipeline. Basically what i learned through setting it up is that it solves a very good problem which i never realised i has that was whenever i used to code for some new organization or person there coding standards are differnt so basically it automatically helps us to adjust to them as this acts as a co-pilot to show us the problems with our code In ryaz we basically follow air-bnb hence it is just one of many standards we can even add something new i have used eslint before but as a visual studio extension but i didnt knew we can seriously change a and customise this much as then i started researching about this tool in detail     ESLint uses Espree for JavaScript parsing learned that ESLint uses an AST to evaluate patterns in code. then basically matches the pattern ESLint is completely pluggable, every single rule is a plugin and you can add more at runtime. i used it to check my projects and i had a lot of errors i am definetally going to use this tool in every single one of my projects in future"
